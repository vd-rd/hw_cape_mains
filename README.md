## Overview
 Isolated mains supply module designed to power IoT projects that have a <15W power requirement. It is designed around readily available step-down power modules with additional filtering to ensure compliance to standard specifications.

### Specifications
Two versions of the board are available, depending on the choice of the module.
 * MeanWell IRM version
 * Aimtec AMEOF version
In both cases the boards feature:
 * 85-240V input
 * 15W output at 12V
 * 5V regulated output using an LDO
 * Current sensor for measuring board consumption
 * IEC-C6 power connector
The board has a small footprint (80x40x25mm) with the power connector protruding an additional 3mm at the edge.
